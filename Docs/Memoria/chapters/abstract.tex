The number of mobile devices is increasing at an exceedingly high rate, translating into an increasing demand of mobile data services. Telecommunication operators must change and adapt their networks to satisfy these tough demands. Dense wireless networks caused by an increasing large amount of mobile nodes in confined areas will be to much for operators to handle because of their limited capacity. Efficiant mobility, signaling and inteference management will be essential, calling the need for localized controllers with this capacity. Centralized mobility management needs to make way for distribution-based arquitecture to improve efficiency and avoid bottlenecks.\\

This project, under the FP7 project CROWD, implements a scenario in which Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Distributed Mobility Management work together to solve these problems and to get a glimpse into the future of wireless networking.
