The lack of expertise that people have on how to perform a good training session has a series of issues. The two issues we encounter are that it leads to inefficiency and bad practices that can lead people to quit or injure themselves. With the cost to have a personal trainer or somebody to manage a personâ€™s training session being very high, there is an opportunity to improve the user experience with automated services that provide relevant information and keeps track of the progress that is being made.

This project implements a trainer chat bot that alleviates the cost of having a personal trainer, but maintaining many of the features they would provide. Over the years chat bots have steadily been incorporated into society, the flexibility and cost chat bots have, makes a very lucrative option for monotonous operations such as some provided by a personal trainer.
