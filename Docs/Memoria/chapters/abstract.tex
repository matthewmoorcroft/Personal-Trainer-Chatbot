The lack of expertise that people have on how to perform a good training session has a series of issues. The two issues we encounter are that it leads to inefficiency and bad practices that can lead people to quit or injure themselves. With the cost to have a personal trainer or somebody to manage a person’s training session being very high, there is an opportunity to improve the user experience with automated services that provide relevant information and keeps track of the progress that is being made.\\

Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since the 1950s and today’s computing capabilities has opened a whole world of possibilities, the evolution of tools in language processing has seen an increasing amount of applications which mix human and machine interaction like nobody has ever imagined.\\

The objective of this project is to explore the capabilities of Machine Learning with Natural Language Processing by using the tools available and study it’s integration with a real-world application such as a trainer chat bot. Over the years chat bots have steadily been incorporated into society, the flexibility and cost chat bots have, makes a very lucrative option for monotonous operations such as some provided by a personal trainer.
