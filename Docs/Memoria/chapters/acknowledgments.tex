This project marks the end of an amazing part of my life, I wouldn't have been able to achieve it without the help of many people.\\

First of all, thanks to my family for supporting me the whole way and making  me feel like anything with hard work can be achieved. Thanks to those words, I have found the strength to not give up even when I thought I wasn't capable of accomplishing what I set out to do.\\

To my partner Maria, thank you so much for making this journey by me, for being there to help me without asking and for making this stage of my life as amazing as it has been. \\

To "Mis Costillas", for making those long afternoons in the library and in class so much more interesting. For the amazing places we have visited throughout these years, thank you.\\

Thank you to my friends for being understanding and helping me disconnect from the long days at university and show me a good time.\\

Thanks to my tutors,Pablo and Carlos, for guiding me through this project and showing interest in helping me express my ideas.\\
