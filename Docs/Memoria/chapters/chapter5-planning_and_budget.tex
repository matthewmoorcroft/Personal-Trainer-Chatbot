\section{Planning}\label{sec:chap5_plan}
The original plan was to develop the whole project in five months in two different stages and documenting the whole process, the first stage was programmed to las two weeks designing and thinking on the objective of the application and making sure that the idea is viable before writing a line of code with a form sent to possible users. The next stage was the development step, first creating the tests that will confirm the application works correctly, this stage was predicted to last 4 months. The following steps can be seen in the Gantt graph on the next page.\\

After the five months of development, due to external factors, the project was seriously delayed and a redesign had to be done as the complexity of the context manager in the original design made it unviable to deliver for this year. This made it necessary to rethink how to adapt the project to reach the target of September for delivery. In order to reach the objective an extension on the different parts of the project have to be done, this included two more weeks of planning and preparation, twelve more weeks of development where the new configuration and implementation was completed, the rest of the extension was filling out the documentation with the new design.\\

Even though this was a setback to the project, it allowed gaining experience in how the perception of time in completing tasks has to be refined in order to avoid overextending a project and having inefficiencies.

To give some context to the different parts of the table we will explain them further. Starting with the hardware the resources needed where a laptop for the development, the smartphone to test the app and the Raspberry Pi for the server, the reason for using the Raspberry Pi 55,5\% of the projects is due to the change in design mid project to use instead the Azure Virtual Machine as the new Server. The cost for the hardware is based on the cost of the product, and the amortization based on the average lifespan of these products.\\

For the software, the only software used was the virtual machine from azure. The reason the cost for the Azure Machine is relative is that it has a pricing system based on paying what you use, meaning that depending on how much you use the resources the pricing varies. For this project the price of usage at the moment of writing this memory has been 40 \euro \space as virtual machine was used only when required to minimize costs.\\

The human resources used in the project were where most of the budget of the project went to, the hourly rate is based on similar projects done and by the knowledge of people in the industry. The developer works 4 hours a day in average on the project for the length of the project considering only working days. For the project manager he works only 5,5 days out of the 22 working days in a month, to control that the project is on track and make adjustments to it.\\

Based on all these costs the total budget for the project is FORTY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT AND TWO CENTS EUROS.
 in the case of this project the virtual machine was used only when required to minimize costs.
