\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chap:11}

By doing this project I have found the complexity when developing conversational chatbots and that there is still a long road ahead in technological innovations to make it easier to develop, but the possible impacts it can have on society inspires me to continue developing the technology and find possible solutions to day to day problems. The progress vocal chatbots are having will provide a new playing field for chatbot development.\\

Even as a proof of concept the project shows that a fully developed product could positively impact on socially and economically, the development must be focused on protecting user’s data and complying with Europe’s GDPR regulation in order to not modify the structure and design of the bot afterwards.\\

The fact of using two designs has helped view the problems on creating a fully proprietary solution such as the complexity of developing the conversational memory of the bot and controlling unhappy paths of conversation where the user deviates from the main line of conversation, but also the first design provided some benefits which were, having the full control of how it works and being able to modifying the core code to make improvements. The second design even though it had a quicker time to market as many core technologies were developed by the Rasa team, the development had to adapt to how the platform worked as certain parts had limited functionality which made it harder to work with, requiring in some instances a workaround to make it work.\\

As a final conclusion the experience of developing this project has been very positive and has provided me a deeper knowledge in the world of AI.
